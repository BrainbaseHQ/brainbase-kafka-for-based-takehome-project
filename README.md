# Brainbase – Vibe-code Agents
Brainbase is a powerful tool for provisioning complex AI agents. Even though our language can be written by humans, it was actually built to be written by AI, so that anyone, technical or non-technical can create their own agent just by talking.

We call it vibe-coding your agents.

We want you to build an early version of our next flagship product: Kafka

## Specifications
Kafka is our version of Cursor/Windsurf for vibe coding AI agents, which works very similarly.

1. The user starts off by describing their idea
2. Kafka creates a `.based` file based on the request
3. The user describes changes and modifications to the agent
4. Kafka creates changes in the form of code diffs and applies them
